<h3>Introducing Airdnc, my Airbnb clone! A web application that leverages the power of React, Redux, and Express to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for property owners and travelers alike. 
<h3>

<h3>
Built using the latest web technologies and best practices, my application provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to list properties and leave reviews. With React at its core, Airdnc offers lightning-fast performance and real-time updates, ensuring that users can access the most up-to-date information on their properties. 
</h3>

<h3>
Redux was utilized to handle state management, providing a predictable and centralized way to manage how data flows within the application. Moreover, Express was used to create a scalable and efficient backend API that seamlessly integrates with the frontend and allows for easy communication with external services. I hope you enjoy Airdnc!
