## Why have Breakfast in Bed when you can have Dinner on a Couch?

</div>

- Introducing Airdnc, my Airbnb clone! A web application that leverages the power of React, Redux, Google Maps API, and Express to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for property owners and travelers alike. 

- Built using the latest web technologies and best practices, my application provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to list properties, book rentals, and leave reviews. With React at its core, Airdnc offers lightning-fast performance and real-time updates, ensuring that users can access the most up-to-date information on their properties. 

- I had the pleasure of collaborating with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-menitra/">Mario Menitra</a>, a skilled UI/UX designer who designed logos and curated a color scheme that captured my vision for the site. The culmination of our collaborative efforts resulted in a unique playful twist of Airbnb's aesthetics.

- Redux was utilized to handle state management, providing a predictable and centralized way to manage how data flows within the application. Moreover, Express was used to create a scalable and efficient backend API that seamlessly integrates with the frontend and allows for easy communication with external services. I hope you enjoy Airdnc!
